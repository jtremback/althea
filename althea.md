Althea is a system that allows routers in a network to pay each other for bandwidth. This allows for a type of network that we are calling an "incentivized mesh network". In this model, users pay for network access, and infrastructure operators are compensated without a middleman or ISP.

We've designed Althea with a point-to-point wireless network in mind, although it could be conceiveably used with many different network architectures. Let's look at two existing ways to run a point-to-point wireless network.

Wireless ISP:
A wireless ISP is a business that leases a high capacity uplink to the internet. It then sets up radio networking equipment to bring internet connectivity to a wider local area, and starts soliciting subscribers. In this model, the business entity of the ISP acts as a middleman, owning and maintaining equipment and making agreements with the owners of equipment installation sites to host the equipment. These activities, as well as the uplink lease, are financed by the subscription fees paid by subscribers. The networking equipment is usually owned by the ISP. Another activity that wireless ISPs engage in is network configuration and routing. Since they own the equipment, they are able to use some combination of manual routing table setup, centralized routing (SDN), and ad-hoc qrouting protocols to move packets through the network.  

Community mesh network:
A community mesh network is similar to a wireless ISP in that it tends to use point-to-point radio networking equipment to provide connectivity. Instead of being a business, community meshes are set up and administered by a community (although there is usually a committed core of volunteers pushing the effort forward). One key difference between a wireless ISP and a community mesh network is that in a community mesh, the networking equipment is typically owned by the individuals hosting it instead of a central entity. Connectivity to the internet is typically provided by the home internet connections of individuals in the mesh. If there is a high capacity uplink, it is typically financed by donations. Packets are routed by ad-hoc routing protocols (Babel, OLSR, BATMAN). Ad-hoc routing protocols are self-configuring, meaning that nodes in the network communicate with one another to route packets without centralized administration. This is a key factor, as it allows the network to function without too much coordination.

Althea:
Althea is a set of protocols for a decentralized point-to-point radio network providing connectivity to an area, where participants in the network are able to pay for connectivity, and receive payment for their contributions to the network, without a centralized ISP collecting subscriptions and owning equipment. It combines the commercial viablity of a wireless ISP with the decentralized nature of a community mesh network. There are two main components- payments and routing.

Nodes route packets using an ad-hoc "mesh" routing protocol. This protocol must take price as well as link quality into
