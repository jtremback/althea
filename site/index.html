          The Internet currently relies on large, monopolistic ISPs. Due to the lack of meaningful competition, they are free to charge exorbitant rates, throttle speeds, and censor content.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're creating a new Internet, a mesh network where routers are owned independently and compensated automatically for providing bandwidth to the network.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're developing IP protocols that have payment built in, creating incentives for rapid expansion and investment in the network, while keeping a completely decentralized architecture without the need for governments or businesses.
