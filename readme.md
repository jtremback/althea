This is a project to introduce payment for data transmission into the fabric of the internet itself, instead of relying on contracts and agreements created and enforced "out of band". We believe this will result in a faster, freer, and more resilient network, resistant to monopolies.

This repository contains ideas, writing, and simulation code.
