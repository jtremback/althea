We're working to replace ISPs with self-organizing networks of independently owned routers. The network automatically compensates each router for the bandwidth it contributes to the network.

The Internet currently relies on large, monopolistic ISPs who are free to charge exorbitant rates, throttle service to rates far below their capacity, and censor content.

We're creating a new Internet, a mesh network where routers are owned independently and compensated automatically for providing bandwidth to the network.

We're developing IP protocols that have payment built in, creating incentives for rapid expansion and investment in the network, while keeping a completely decentralized architecture without the need for governments or businesses.
